### Overview
For design decision of the project I researched different task management site and then take one as reference. I followed ui/ux theory like user interaction with card, button. I kept in mind user experience and try to keep the application minimalistic and simple.

### Redux
For redux setup First I created a file called baseApi.ts. here I give base url and all endpoints handled by injecting this baseapi. I took two file to handle one for authapi and one for taskapi.

### Follow the below instructions to run the application in your local machine
